At the beginning of July, I took part in the Summer School "Medieval and Early Modern Theories of Cognition" with a talk on the KK thesis and externalism in Aquinas. The participants in this School, which took place at the University of Porto, discussed theories of knowledge, epistemology and the mind-body-soul problem in Medieval and Modern Philosophy. It was an enjoyable time doing good philosophy. Something to repeat in the future! https://dfaria.eu/file/240718-083744.jpeg https://social.dfaria.eu/?hashtag=2024-07-18T07:40:01Z
