On October 10th, 2024, we held the first part of the workshop Social Frameworks: From Epistemology to Aesthetics at the University of Porto. John Greco defended an anti-individualist version of virtue epistemology; Tiago Veloso proposed improvements to the apriori non-reductionist model of testimony using a logic of belief revision; and I argued that conversational AIs, such as ChatGPT, are testifiers. The discussions were very fruitful. It was a really productive day. Thanks to all the participants. https://dfaria.eu/story/241012-084349.jpeg https://dfaria.eu/story/241012-084238.jpeg https://dfaria.eu/story/241012-084222.jpeg https://ifilosofia.up.pt/activities/social-frameworks https://dfaria.eu/news?archive=2024-10-12T13:51:44Z
